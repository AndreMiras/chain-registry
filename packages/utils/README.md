This module provides utility functions for working with the data in the chain-registry, focusing on asset and chain data management within the Interchain ecosystem.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @chain-registry/utils
```

## Usage

### Assets

Import the required types and functions from the package:

```js
import {
  getAssetByDenom,
  getAssetBySymbol,
  getChainLogo,
  getChainNameByDenom,
  getChainNameByStakingDenom,
  getCoinGeckoIdByDenom,
  getDenomByCoinGeckoId,
  getDenomBySymbol,
  getExponentByDenom,
  getExponentBySymbol,
  getNativeTokenByChainName,
  getSymbolByDenom,
  getTokenLogoByDenom,
  getTokenNameByDenom
} from '@chain-registry/utils';

// import from chain-registry or your own AssetList[]
import { assets } from 'chain-registry';

```

The module includes functions like `getAssetByDenom`, `getAssetBySymbol`, `getDenomByCoinGeckoId`, etc., to retrieve specific asset information from the `chain-registry`.

#### Asset Examples

To find an asset by its denomination:

```js
const asset = getAssetByDenom(assets, 'uosmo', 'osmosis');
console.log(asset?.base); // 'uosmo'
```

To get the logo URL of a chain:

```js
const logo = getChainLogo(assets, 'comdex');
console.log(logo); // 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmos/chain-registry/master/comdex/images/cmdx.png'
```

To retrieve the CoinGecko ID by asset denomination:

```js
const coinGeckoId = getCoinGeckoIdByDenom(assets, 'uosmo');
console.log(coinGeckoId); // 'osmosis'
```

#### Asset Functions

- `getAssetByDenom`: Retrieve an asset by its denomination.
- `getAssetBySymbol`: Find an asset by its symbol.
- `getChainLogo`: Get the logo URL of a chain.
- `getChainNameByDenom`: Determine the chain name given an asset's denomination.
- `getChainNameByStakingDenom`: Find the chain name by its staking token denomination.
- `getCoinGeckoIdByDenom`: Get the CoinGecko ID associated with an asset denomination.
- `getDenomByCoinGeckoId`: Find the denomination for an asset given its CoinGecko ID.
- `getSymbolByDenom`: Retrieve the symbol associated with a denomination.
- `getDenomBySymbol`: Get the denomination of an asset by its symbol.
- `getExponentByDenom`: Find the exponent for a denomination.
- `getExponentBySymbol`: Get the exponent for a symbol.
- `getNativeTokenByChainName`: Retrieve the native token for a given chain name.
- `getTokenLogoByDenom`: Get the logo URL for a token by its denomination.
- `getTokenNameByDenom`: Find the name of a token by its denomination.
