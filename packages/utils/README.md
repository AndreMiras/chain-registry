## Installation

```bash
npm install @chain-registry/utils
```

## Usage

### Chain Utilities

Chain Utilities enable the retrieval and management of blockchain-specific data, such as chain names, chain IDs, and gas prices.

#### Chain Examples

Import the functions from the package:

```js
import {
  getGasPriceRangesFromChain,
  getChainByChainName,
  getChainByChainId,
  getChainNameByChainId,
  getChainIdByChainName,
  getChainGasPriceRanges,
  getChainPrettyName,
  getChainBech32Prefix
} from '@chain-registry/utils';

// import from chain-registry or your own Chain[]
import { chains } from 'chain-registry';
```

To retrieve a chain object by its name:

```ts
const chain = getChainByChainName(chains, 'osmosis');
// { chain_name: 'osmosis', ... }
```

To get the chain ID by its name:

```ts
const chainId = getChainIdByChainName(chains, 'osmosis');
// 'osmosis-1'
```

To get the pretty name of a chain:

```ts
const prettyName = getChainPrettyName(chains, 'osmosis');
// 'Osmosis'
```

To find the gas price ranges for a chain:

```ts
const gasPriceRanges = getChainGasPriceRanges(chains, 'osmosis');
// { low: number, average: number, high: number }
```

#### Chain Functions

- `getGasPriceRangesFromChain`: Returns the gas price ranges (low, average, high) for a given chain.
- `getChainByChainName`: Finds a chain by its name.
- `getChainByChainId`: Retrieves a chain by its chain ID.
- `getChainNameByChainId`: Gets the chain name associated with a given chain ID.
- `getChainIdByChainName`: Fetches the chain ID for a specified chain name.
- `getChainGasPriceRanges`: Provides the gas price ranges for a specified chain name.
- `getChainPrettyName`: Returns the pretty (display) name of the chain.
- `getChainBech32Prefix`: Gets the Bech32 prefix for a given chain.

### Asset Utilities

Asset Utilities facilitate access to details of blockchain assets, including denominations, symbols, and related chain data.

#### Asset Examples

Import the functions from the package:

```js
import {
  getAssetByDenom,
  getAssetBySymbol,
  getChainLogo,
  getChainNameByDenom,
  getChainNameByStakingDenom,
  getCoinGeckoIdByDenom,
  getDenomByCoinGeckoId,
  getDenomBySymbol,
  getExponentByDenom,
  getExponentBySymbol,
  getNativeTokenByChainName,
  getSymbolByDenom,
  getTokenLogoByDenom,
  getTokenNameByDenom
} from '@chain-registry/utils';

// import from chain-registry or your own AssetList[]
import { assets } from 'chain-registry';

```

To find an asset by its denomination:

```js
const asset = getAssetByDenom(assets, 'uosmo', 'osmosis');
console.log(asset?.base); // 'uosmo'
```

To get the logo URL of a chain:

```js
const logo = getChainLogo(assets, 'comdex');
console.log(logo); // 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmos/chain-registry/master/comdex/images/cmdx.png'
```

To retrieve the CoinGecko ID by asset denomination:

```js
const coinGeckoId = getCoinGeckoIdByDenom(assets, 'uosmo');
console.log(coinGeckoId); // 'osmosis'
```

#### Asset Functions

- `getAssetByDenom`: Retrieve an asset by its denomination.
- `getAssetBySymbol`: Find an asset by its symbol.
- `getChainLogo`: Get the logo URL of a chain.
- `getChainNameByDenom`: Determine the chain name given an asset's denomination.
- `getChainNameByStakingDenom`: Find the chain name by its staking token denomination.
- `getCoinGeckoIdByDenom`: Get the CoinGecko ID associated with an asset denomination.
- `getDenomByCoinGeckoId`: Find the denomination for an asset given its CoinGecko ID.
- `getSymbolByDenom`: Retrieve the symbol associated with a denomination.
- `getDenomBySymbol`: Get the denomination of an asset by its symbol.
- `getExponentByDenom`: Find the exponent for a denomination.
- `getExponentBySymbol`: Get the exponent for a symbol.
- `getNativeTokenByChainName`: Retrieve the native token for a given chain name.
- `getTokenLogoByDenom`: Get the logo URL for a token by its denomination.
- `getTokenNameByDenom`: Find the name of a token by its denomination.

### Calculation Utilities

These functions provide utilities for converting asset units and calculating their values based on market data.

#### Calculation Examples

```js
import {
  mapCoinGeckoPricesToDenoms,
  convertBaseUnitToDollarValue,
  convertDollarValueToBaseUnit,
  convertBaseUnitToDisplayUnit,
  convertDisplayUnitToBaseUnit,
  roundDown
} from '@chain-registry/utils';
```

This function maps prices obtained from CoinGecko to the corresponding denominations in the asset list, facilitating price-related calculations.

```ts
const priceMap = mapCoinGeckoPricesToDenoms(assets, coinGeckoPrices);
// priceMap will now contain a mapping of denominations to their USD prices
```


Convert an amount in the base unit of a specified asset to its dollar value using the provided price map.

```ts
const dollarValue = convertBaseUnitToDollarValue(assets, priceMap, 'OSMO', 1000000);
// dollarValue is the total value in USD of 1,000,000 base units of OSMO
```

Convert a dollar value into the base unit of the specified asset, based on the current price.

```ts
const baseUnit = convertDollarValueToBaseUnit(assets, priceMap, 'OSMO', 100);
// baseUnit is the amount in base units of OSMO that equals 100 USD
```

Converts an amount from the base unit to the display unit for the specified asset.

```ts
const displayUnit = convertBaseUnitToDisplayUnit(assets, 'OSMO', 1000000);
// displayUnit is the representation of 1,000,000 base units in display units (e.g., OSMO)
```

Converts an amount from the display unit to the base unit for the specified asset.

```ts
const baseUnit = convertDisplayUnitToBaseUnit(assets, 'OSMO', 1);
// baseUnit is the amount in base units that corresponds to 1 display unit (e.g., 1 OSMO)
```

Rounds down a number to the nearest integer, ensuring consistent lower-bound calculations in financial operations.

```ts
const rounded = roundDown(123.4567);
// rounded will be '123'
```

#### Calculation Functions

- `mapCoinGeckoPricesToDenoms`: Maps CoinGecko price data to asset denominations.
- `convertBaseUnitToDollarValue`: Converts an amount in the base unit of an asset to its dollar value.
- `convertDollarValueToBaseUnit`: Converts a dollar value into the base unit of a specified asset.
- `convertBaseUnitToDisplayUnit`: Converts an amount from the base unit to the display unit of an asset.
- `convertDisplayUnitToBaseUnit`: Converts an amount from the display unit to the base unit of an asset.
- `roundDown`: Rounds down a number to the nearest integer.
